description: A demonstration of how to use JWT authentication in the router with
  the `@requiresScopes` directive when the JWT does not use the standard scope
  JWT claim. In this example, it is instead stored as an array of strings on an
  `authorizations` claim in the JWT. The Rhai script in this repo converts it to
  the format expected by the router.
